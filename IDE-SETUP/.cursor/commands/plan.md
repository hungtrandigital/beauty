# plan

Use **Plan Mode** for roadmaps, requirements, architecture, and specs.

## Steps
1) Read `INDEX.md` for structure
2) Follow `0-agents/mode/plan.md`
3) Use product planning: `0-agents/agents/product-strategist.md`
4) Use architecture: `0-agents/agents/system-architecture.md`
5) Write requirements in `2-product-foundation/requirements/[feature]/`
6) Define architecture/APIs in `3-technical/3.1-system-foundation/`
7) Document ADRs in `8-governance/decision-log.md`

## Output locations
- `2-product-foundation/` (overview, backlog, requirements)
- `3-technical/3.1-system-foundation/` (system-design, domain-specs, api-contracts, infrastructure)
- `3-technical/3.2-implementation/plans/`
- `4-marketing/go-to-market.md`
- `5-financing/plans.md`
- `8-governance/decision-log.md` (ADRs)

## Handoff
Use the orchestration format in `0-agents/mode/plan.md` (`Current mode: plan`, files, blockers, next agent).
