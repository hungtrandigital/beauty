# execution

Use **Execution Mode** to build deliverables (code, designs, assets).

## Steps
1) Read `INDEX.md` for structure
2) Follow `0-agents/mode/execution.md`
3) If coding: follow `0-agents/agents/fullstack-engineer.md`
4) Keep code in `3-technical/3.4-source-code/`
5) Write tests (≥90% coverage for new code)
6) Update progress/changelog if applicable

## Output locations
- `3-technical/3.4-source-code/` (frontend, backend, tests, db)
- `shared/assets/` (ui-ux, graphics, brand)
- `4-marketing/creatives/`, `4-marketing/copy/`
- `3-technical/3.3-devops/` (configs, pipelines)
- `3-technical/3.2-implementation/status/progress.md`
- `8-governance/changelog.md`

## Handoff
Use the orchestration format in `0-agents/mode/execution.md` (`Current mode: execution`, files, tests status, next agent).
