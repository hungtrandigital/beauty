## Market Sizing Methodology

### Total Addressable Market (TAM)

**Definition:** Total revenue opportunity if 100% of the target market adopted our solution.

**Calculation Approach:**
1. Total number of barbershops and beauty salons in Vietnam
2. Average software spend per location
3. Market penetration assumption

**Data Points (Updated 2025-01):**
- **Barbershops:** 5,359-30,730 locations nationwide (wide range due to methodology differences)
  - HCMC: 358 barbershops
  - Hanoi: 40+ barbershops
- **Spas:** 21,282 locations nationwide
  - HCMC: 465 spas
- **Beauty Salons:** Estimated 2,000-4,000 locations nationwide (based on industry analysis)
  - HCMC: 23 reported (likely undercounted)
- **Total Addressable Locations:** ~28,641-55,012+ locations (using conservative barbershop count)
  - **Conservative Estimate:** ~28,641 locations (5,359 barbershops + 21,282 spas + 2,000 beauty salons)
  - **Optimistic Estimate:** ~55,012 locations (30,730 barbershops + 21,282 spas + 3,000 beauty salons)

**TAM Calculation (Updated 2025-01):**
- **Conservative:** 28,641 locations × 1,000,000 VND/month × 12 months = **343.7 billion VND/year** (~USD 13.7 million/year)
- **Optimistic:** 55,012 locations × 1,500,000 VND/month × 12 months = **990.2 billion VND/year** (~USD 39.6 million/year)

**TAM Range:** **343.7-990.2 billion VND/year** (~USD 13.7-39.6 million/year)

**Note:** Previous estimate (66-198 billion VND/year) was based on limited data. Updated figures reflect more comprehensive market research.

### Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM)

- Multi-location chains: ~10-15% of total market (550-1,650 locations)
- Single locations with expansion plans: ~20-25% of total market (1,100-2,750 locations)
- **Total SAM:** ~1,650-4,400 locations

**SAM Calculation:**
- **Conservative:** 1,650 locations × 1,000,000 VND/month × 12 months = **19.8 billion VND/year** (~USD 790,000/year)
- **Optimistic:** 4,400 locations × 1,500,000 VND/month × 12 months = **79.2 billion VND/year** (~USD 3.2 million/year)

- **Year 3:** 2-5% of SAM (33-220 locations)
- **Year 5:** 5-10% of SAM (83-440 locations)
