**Calculation Approach:**
1. Total number of barbershops and beauty salons in Vietnam
2. Average software spend per location
3. Market penetration assumption

**Data Points:**
- **Barbershops:** 40+ in Hanoi alone (extrapolating to Vietnam: ~500-1,000 barbershops)
- **Beauty Salons/Spas:** Estimated 5,000-10,000+ locations nationwide
- **Total Addressable Locations:** ~5,500-11,000 locations

**TAM Calculation:**
- **Conservative:** 5,500 locations × 1,000,000 VND/month × 12 months = **66 billion VND/year** (~USD 2.6 million/year)
- **Optimistic:** 11,000 locations × 1,500,000 VND/month × 12 months = **198 billion VND/year** (~USD 7.9 million/year)

**TAM Range:** **66-198 billion VND/year** (~USD 2.6-7.9 million/year)
