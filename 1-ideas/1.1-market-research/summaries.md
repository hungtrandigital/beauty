# Market Research Summaries

**Last Updated:** 2025-01-XX (Updated market size data and added Myspa, EasySalon competitors)

## Executive Summary

The Vietnamese barbershop and beauty chain management software market presents a significant opportunity with a Total Addressable Market (TAM) of 343.7-990.2 billion VND/year (~USD 13.7-39.6M/year) (Updated 2025-01). The market is moderately competitive with several local and international players, but most solutions lack comprehensive multi-location inventory management with approval workflows—a key differentiator of our product based on Vu Tri Barbershop's proven system.

**Key Opportunity:** Multi-location barbershops and beauty chains (6-20 locations) represent the primary target market, with an estimated 200-500 locations in Vietnam. Our product's unique features—central warehouse management, approval workflows, offline mode, and complex promotion engine—address significant market gaps.

**Critical Customer Insight:** Chain owners are often self-made entrepreneurs who started from humble backgrounds, built their businesses through hard work and determination, and may have limited formal education (some below high school). This insight has profound implications for product design (simplicity is critical), messaging (simple, direct language), marketing channels (Facebook, Zalo, word-of-mouth), and support approach (hands-on training, patient support). See [Target Audience Insights](reports/target-audience-insights-2025-12.md) for detailed analysis.

This has significant implications for product design, messaging, marketing channels, and support approach.

**Feature Insight:** Shop owners appreciate proactive recommendations from the system (not AI, but simple system logic) such as inventory alerts ("Refill your product"), revenue trends ("Revenue is up/down"), and revenue source analysis ("From which product/services"). See [Smart Recommendations Feature Idea](../feature-idea-smart-recommendations.md) for details.

## Security Testing Strategy

**Research:** See [Security Testing Strategy](../security-testing-strategy-2025-12.md) for comprehensive analysis of implementing security testing at the beginning phase.

**Key Finding:** **YES, implement security testing from Sprint 1** - Shift-left security approach is critical for multi-tenant SaaS platform handling financial data. Cost-benefit analysis shows 100x cost savings by fixing security issues early ($100 vs. $10,000+ post-launch).

**Recommendation:** Implement automated security testing (SAST, DAST, dependency scanning) from Sprint 1, add security to code review process, write security unit tests, and conduct security architecture review. This prevents costly security vulnerabilities and protects customer data.

**Status:** Analysis complete, risk added to risk register (RISK-002).
