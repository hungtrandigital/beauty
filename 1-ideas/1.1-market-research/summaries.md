# Market Research Summaries

**Last Updated:** 2025-12-09

## Executive Summary

The Vietnamese barbershop and beauty chain management software market presents a significant opportunity with a Total Addressable Market (TAM) of 66-198 billion VND/year (~USD 2.6-7.9M/year). The market is moderately competitive with several local and international players, but most solutions lack comprehensive multi-location inventory management with approval workflows—a key differentiator of our product based on Vu Tri Barbershop's proven system.

**Key Opportunity:** Multi-location barbershops and beauty chains (6-20 locations) represent the primary target market, with an estimated 200-500 locations in Vietnam. Our product's unique features—central warehouse management, approval workflows, offline mode, and complex promotion engine—address significant market gaps.
