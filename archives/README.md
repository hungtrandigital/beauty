# Archives

## Purpose

This directory serves as a long-term archive for old versions of documentation, deprecated content, and historical records. Archive content periodically to maintain a clean active workspace while preserving history.

## Archive Strategy

### When to Archive

Archive content when:
- *Major version changes occur*
- *Sections are significantly restructured*
- *Content becomes outdated but should be preserved*
- *Annual cleanup (e.g., move old content yearly)*

### Archive Organization

Organize archives by:
- *Version (e.g., v1-ideas-2025/)*
- *Date (e.g., 2025-01/)*
- *Section (e.g., old-technical-specs/)*

## Archive Structure

### Example Structure
```
archives/
├── v1-ideas-2025/
│   └── [old ideas content]
├── 2025-01/
│   └── [content from January 2025]
└── deprecated/
    └── [deprecated content]
```

## Archive Process

1. **Identify Content** - Determine what should be archived
2. **Create Archive Directory** - Create appropriately named directory
3. **Move Content** - Move files to archive directory
4. **Update Links** - Update any active links that referenced archived content
5. **Document** - Add note in archive directory about what was archived and when
