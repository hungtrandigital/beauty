# 2. Product Foundation

## Purpose

This section contains all product-related documentation, including product overview, backlog management, and requirements. This is where ideas from [1-ideas/](../1-ideas/README.md) are transformed into concrete product specifications.

## Navigation

### Key Documents

- **[2.1 Product Overview](2.1-product-overview.md)** - High-level product definition and vision
- **[2.2 Product Backlog](2.2-product-backlog/backlog.md)** - Epics, user stories, and feature backlog
- **[requirements/](requirements/)** - Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) linking to technical domain specs

## Workflow

1. **Define Product** - Start with [2.1-product-overview.md](2.1-product-overview.md)
2. **Create Backlog** - Build epics and stories in [2.2-product-backlog/](2.2-product-backlog/)
3. **Write Requirements** - Document PRDs in `requirements/` that link to technical specs
4. **Link to Technical** - Connect requirements to [3-technical/](../3-technical/README.md) domain specifications

## Related Sections

- **[1-ideas/](../1-ideas/README.md)** - Source of product ideas and market research
- **[3-technical/3.1-system-foundation/architecture/domain-specs.md](../3-technical/3.1-system-foundation/architecture/domain-specs.md)** - Technical specifications derived from requirements
- **[3-technical/3.2-implementation/](../3-technical/3.2-implementation/README.md)** - Implementation tracking
