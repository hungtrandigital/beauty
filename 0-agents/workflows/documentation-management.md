# Documentation Management & Archiving Protocol — AI-First Startup Factory (v2.1)

This file is the strict policy enforced by the Docs Guardian agent and all other agents.  
It ensures the repository always remains clean, up-to-date, and reflects current reality — no outdated plans, no duplicate specs, no garbage after 10–20 years.

## Core Rule: Latest & Unique
There is exactly ONE canonical, up-to-date version of every document at any time.  
Everything else is either historical (archived) or temporary (will be moved/deleted).

## Lifecycle & Movement Rules

| Document Type                          | Current location (active)                 | When executed/completed → move to                                  | Leave behind                                                                 |

## Docs Guardian Agent Responsibilities (automatic)

Every time any agent finishes a task, Docs Guardian must run these checks:

1. Scan for outdated documents:
   - Any file containing words “initial”, “draft”, “old”, “v1”, “backup”
   - Any plan file older than current sprint/quarter that is not in archives/

2. Move outdated files:
   - Create folder archives/YYYY-MM-DD-description/(date = today)
   - Move file(s) there
   - Replace original file with a single line:
     → Archived 2025-12-09: [../archives/2025-12-09-description/filename.md]

3. Update links (automatic & mandatory)
   After every move, deletion, or rename, the responsible agent (usually Docs Guardian) must immediately update the following places to keep navigation perfect:

   - ./INDEX.md → Quick Links section
     - Remove old path
     - Add new path or archived link
     - Keep alphabetical order inside each category

   - All README.md files that previously linked to the old document
     - Replace direct links with the new/current location
     - Example before:
       [User Authentication Plan](3-technical/3.2-implementation/plans/user-auth-plan.md)
     - Example after archiving:
       User Authentication Plan → Archived 2025-12-09: [../archives/2025-12-09-user-auth-plan/user-auth-plan.md]

   - 8-governance/changelog.md
     Add one line (date in YYYY-MM-DD):
     2025-12-09 │ Archived │ 3-technical/3.2-implementation/plans/user-auth-plan.md → archives/2025-12-09-user-auth-plan/

   - 3-technical/3.2-implementation/status/progress.md (if code-related)
     Update “Completed items” table with link to archived plan

   - Any Mermaid diagrams or cross-references in active documents
     Point to the new canonical location

   Failure to update links within the same session will trigger Docs Guardian to revert the change and notify human.
