# Tone of Voice

**Last Updated:** 2025-12-09  
**Version:** 1.0

## Overview

Our brand voice is the personality we express in all written and spoken communication. It's how we sound to our audience—the barbershop and beauty chain owners across Vietnam who trust us to manage their operations.

**Important Context:** Many of our target customers are self-made entrepreneurs who started from humble backgrounds and built their businesses through hard work and determination. Some have limited formal education (high school or below). Our voice must be respectful, understanding, and accessible—never condescending or overly technical.

## Core Voice Principles

### 1. **Confident but Humble**
- We're proud of our proven track record, but we're here to serve, not to boast
- **Do:** "Our system has managed 18 locations for 3 years—we understand your challenges"
- **Don't:** "We're the best and everyone else is inferior"

### 2. **Professional but Approachable**
- Enterprise-grade capabilities without enterprise-grade attitude
- **Do:** "Let's streamline your inventory management"
- **Don't:** "Leverage our enterprise-grade inventory optimization solution"

### 3. **Clear and Direct**
- No jargon, no fluff—just clear communication that gets to the point
- **Do:** "Track inventory across all locations in real-time"
- **Don't:** "Harness the power of real-time, multi-location inventory synchronization"

### 4. **Respectful and Understanding**
- We know running a chain is hard work—we respect that
- **Do:** "We know managing multiple locations is complex—we built this to help"
- **Don't:** "You're doing it wrong—here's how to fix it"

### 5. **Solution-Focused**
- We talk about outcomes and benefits, not just features
- **Do:** "Save 5 hours per week on inventory management"
- **Don't:** "Our system includes advanced inventory tracking capabilities"
