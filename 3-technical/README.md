# 3. Technical

## Purpose

This section contains all technical documentation, including system architecture, implementation details, DevOps configuration, and code. This is where product requirements are translated into technical specifications and implementation.

## Navigation

### Main Sections

- **[3.1 System Foundation](3.1-system-foundation/)** - Infrastructure, architecture, and design standards
- **[3.2 Implementation](3.2-implementation/README.md)** - Implementation details, history, and plans
- **[3.3 DevOps](3.3-devops/README.md)** - DevOps configuration and deployment
- **[3.4 Source Code](3.4-source-code/README.md)** - Source code organization

## Workflow

1. **Design System** - Start with [3.1-system-foundation/](3.1-system-foundation/) for architecture
2. **Plan Implementation** - Use [3.2-implementation/plans/](3.2-implementation/plans/) for detailed plans
3. **Track Progress** - Monitor status in [3.2-implementation/status/](3.2-implementation/status/)
4. **Implement** - Write code in [3.4-source-code/](3.4-source-code/)
5. **Deploy** - Configure DevOps in [3.3-devops/](3.3-devops/)

## Related Sections

- **[2-product-foundation/](../2-product-foundation/README.md)** - Product requirements that inform technical specs
- **[7-operations-monitoring/](../7-operations-monitoring/README.md)** - Post-deployment monitoring
